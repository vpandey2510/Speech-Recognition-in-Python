# Speech-Recognition-in-Python

This is a mini project which shows the use of speech recognition technology and its application using Tkinter GUI and other Python libraries. 
This project has two sections: dealing with speech recognition and combining it with GUI.

Modules used in the project:
1. Tkinter
2. SpeechRecogniton
3. PyAudio
4. Google Speech API

The flowchart for the program goes like:
Opening of Window Panel -> Starting audio input using button -> Identifying the microphone -> Recognizing the voice using Google Speech API -> Displaying output after  conversion

Following are the function used in the project:
1. Label()
2. Button()
3. Mainloop()
4. Recognizer()
5. Microphone()
6. Listen()
7. Recognizer_Google()
8. Exit()

It could be used for any language available on Google Speech API. I tried it for english and hindi only. 
The output will come written in english only, even if you say any other language.
